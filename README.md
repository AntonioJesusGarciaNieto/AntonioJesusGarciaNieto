### Technologies 💻

The programming languages I can use are Python 🐍, Java, C++, SQL ... but my favourite is Python.

I have programmed web pages with Python, using the Django framework. I have also created pages with Java, and JavaScript with frameworks such as Spring Boot and Angular.

But my passion is artificial intelligence ⚙️🤖⚙️, in particular the field of deep learning.  The problem I have worked on the most is the classification of images.
